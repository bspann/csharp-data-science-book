# Market Research: C# Developers & ML

## Key Findings from Reddit/Stack Overflow (Feb 2026)

### Pain Points
1. **Resource scarcity**: "There is no detailed tutorial or project on ML.NET anywhere"
2. **Outdated content**: "I found one book online. It's old and complicated."
3. **Python dominance frustration**: College AI students who love .NET feel forced into Python
4. **Self-learners blocked**: People who learn by doing (ASP.NET, EF, Blazor) hit a wall with ML.NET
5. **Skepticism**: "ML.NET seems a little too good to be true - what's the catch?"

### What They Want
- Project-based learning (like Udemy courses for other .NET frameworks)
- Modern, up-to-date content
- Clear transition path from app dev to data science
- Honest comparison: when to use ML.NET vs Python
- Enterprise/production deployment guidance

### Common Questions
- "Is C# viable for machine learning?"
- "How can I learn ML.NET?" (with frustration about lack of resources)
- "Is .NET reliable for ML?" (especially for custom model architectures)
- "What's the catch with ML.NET?"

### Competitive Gaps
- Existing ML.NET books are 4+ years old (2020 era)
- No curriculum-based approach (12-week structured path)
- Matt Eland's 2024 book is closest competitor but focused on Polyglot Notebooks
- No book specifically addresses the "app dev to data scientist" mindset shift

### Our Differentiators
1. **Fresh content**: ML.NET 4.x, .NET 8, Azure ML (2026 current)
2. **Curriculum structure**: Based on proven MS ML-For-Beginners format
3. **Mindset chapters**: Explicit coverage of how DS thinking differs from app dev
4. **Project-driven**: Every chapter has a hands-on project
5. **Full journey**: From basics to production MLOps
